# habitica-clone
Created with CodeSandbox

### Description

Habitica-clone is a gamified task list.  In it's current state Habitica-clone is deployed and connects to an API I built
with elixir in the phoenix framework.  It is my first big project.  I started developing this application in early march.
In four short months I managed to learn Vue.js, Elixir, and phoenix to deploy this cool application.

### Understanding the Current UI

- Use the + in the top right to create a task
- Click a task to "finish" it and provide rewards to the universal player

### Planned Features (Near Future)

- Authentication (each user has their own player and tasks)
- Ability to delete tasks from DB
- Ability to re-order tasks

### Planned Features (Long Term)

- Ability to battle monster entity for rewards
- Store for spending of gold
- Items that affect characters HP
- Inventory to view items
- Much much more
